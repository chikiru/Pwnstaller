#Pwnstaller

Pwnstaller is a tool to generate and compile a dynamically-obfuscated version of the Pyinstaller runw.exe loader.

This is the loader used by Veil-Evasion to package up AV-evading Python payloads.

Pwnstaller was developed by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y).

runw_orig.exe is copy of the original runw.exe packaged with Pyinstaller.


##Setup (tldr;)

If you already have Veil-Evasion installed, all the depencies should already be met. 
Otherwise, run ./setup.sh on Kali x86.
Only tested on Kali linux, no promises otherwise.
